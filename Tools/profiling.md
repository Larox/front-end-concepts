of memory used by the application. Network profiling measures the time it takes
to load resources from the network.

## Profiling Techniques

To use the profiling features in DevTools, there are multiple techniques that
can be used, including recording and analyzing performance data, analyzing code
coverage, and simulating different network conditions.

## Conclusion

Profiling help to optimize the performance of their web applications. With its
powerful profiling features, the performance issues can be easy to identify and
to ensure that the application is running smoothly and efficiently.
