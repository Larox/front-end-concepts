# Chrome DevTools: Console / Sources

The Console / Sources panel allows to interact with the JavaScript console and
debug web applications.

The Console allows to execute JavaScript code directly in the browser. It
can be used to evaluate expressions, interact with the DOM, and analyze code
performance. It can be use to log messages to the console for debugging
purposes.

## Debugging JavaScript

The Sources panel allows to debug JavaScript code by setting
breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables. This can be a
powerful tool for identifying and fixing bugs in web applications.

## Inspecting Resources

The Sources panel also provides access to all resources loaded by the web
application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It can be used to
inspect the source code of these files and make changes on the fly.
