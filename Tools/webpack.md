# What is Webpack?

Webpack is a popular module bundler used in front-end development. It allows
to bundle multiple files and dependencies into a single, optimized
file that can be served to the browser.

# How it works?

Webpack works by bundling together multiple files and dependencies into a
single, optimized file that can be served to the browser.

In a detailed, but summarized manner, this is how Webpack works:

**Entry points:** Webpack starts with one or more entry points, which are specified
in the Webpack configuration file. Each entry point represents a file that will
be processed by Webpack and included in the final bundle. Entry points can be
any type of file that can be loaded by Webpack, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML,
and more.

**Loaders:** After determining the entry points, Webpack uses loaders to preprocess
each file before it is included in the bundle. Loaders are configured in the
Webpack configuration file and can be used to transform files from one format to
another, such as converting SASS files to CSS or transpiling TypeScript to
JavaScript. Loaders can also be used to perform other tasks, such as minifying
code or optimizing images.

**Dependency graph:** Webpack creates a dependency graph that represents the
relationships between the files that are being bundled. The dependency graph is
based on the code and comments in the files, as well as any import or require
statements that are used to load other files. Webpack analyzes the dependency
graph to determine the order in which the files should be bundled.

**Output:** After processing all of the files and dependencies, Webpack generates a
single optimized bundle that includes all of the code required by the
application. The output file is specified in the Webpack configuration file and
can be any type of file that can be loaded by the browser, such as a JavaScript
file, CSS file, or HTML file.

**Plugins:** In addition to loaders, Webpack also includes plugins that can be used
to perform additional tasks during the bundling process. Plugins can be used to
perform tasks such as generating HTML files, extracting CSS into separate files,
or optimizing code for production.

Overall, the Webpack helps to simplify the of managing dependencies and building
complex applications. Webpack analyze the dependency graph and pre-process each
file with loaders with this process it is able to generate an optimized bundle
that includes only the code that is required by the application. This reduces
the size of the bundle and improves the performance of the application by making
it faster and more efficient.
