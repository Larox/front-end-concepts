# Differences of UX and UI

UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) are both critical components of the
design process for digital products, such as websites and mobile applications.

They are closely related, there are key differences between UX and UI:

- **User Interface (UI):** refers to the design of the visual elements and
  controls of a digital product that users interact with. This includes buttons,
  menus, icons, and other visual elements that help users interact with the
  product. UI designers focus on the look and feel of the product, as well as its
  layout and interactivity.

- **User Experience (UX):** refers to the overall experience a user has when
  interacting with a digital product. It encompasses all aspects of the user's
  interaction with the product, including the UI, the product's usability, and the
  user's emotional response to the product. UX designers focus on understanding
  user needs, behaviors, and motivations to create a product that meets those
  needs and provides a positive experience.

In summary, UI designers focus on the look and feel of a digital product, while
UX designers focus on the overall user experience. While there is some overlap
between the two disciplines, they are distinct and both are necessary for
creating a successful digital product.
