# LESS

LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) is another preprocessor that adds several features to
CSS, such as variables, mixins, and functions. LESS also uses a syntax that is
similar to CSS but adds new functionality. For example, LESS allows the use of
variables, which makes it easier to reuse values throughout a stylesheet. LESS
also allows the use of mixins, which can be used to define reusable blocks of
CSS code that can be applied to different selectors. Additionally, LESS includes
functions, which can be used to manipulate values in the stylesheet.
