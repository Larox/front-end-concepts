# SASS

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor that adds several
features to CSS, such as variables, nesting, and mixins. SASS uses a syntax that
is similar to CSS but adds new functionality. For example, SASS allows the use
of variables, which makes it easier to reuse values throughout a stylesheet.
SASS also allows the nesting of selectors, which makes it easier to write more
organized and readable code. Another feature of SASS is mixins, which allow
developers to define reusable blocks of CSS code that can be applied to
different selectors.
